# John Keppe | Build-to-Solve Portfolio

A high-impact, responsive portfolio website designed to showcase administrative efficiency through data visualization and rapid prototyping.

## 🚀 The Philosophy
Unlike a traditional resume, this site is built to demonstrate my "Build-to-Solve" mindset. I focus on identifying manual bottlenecks and building digital systems to eliminate them. This portfolio itself is an example of **Rapid Prototyping**—using modern tools to deploy a professional solution quickly.

## 📊 Key Visual Features
- **Impact Dashboard:** An interactive bar chart (via Chart.js) visualizing a 50% reduction in transcript processing time and $2,000+ in annual cost savings.
- **Problem/Solution Matrix:** A structured breakdown of professional challenges and the technical systems I built to solve them.
- **Modern Tech Stack:** Visual badges highlighting proficiency in AI Prompt Engineering, Zapier Automation, and CRM management.

## 🛠️ Built With
- **HTML5 & Tailwind CSS:** For a modern, mobile-first responsive design.
- **Chart.js:** To provide data-driven evidence of professional impact.
- **Google Gemini:** Strategic AI thought partnership for architecture, content refinement, and data visualization logic.
- **FontAwesome:** For intuitive visual navigation.
- **GitHub Pages:** For automated deployment.
